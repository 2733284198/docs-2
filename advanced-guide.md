# Developer Standards and Patterns

## Repository naming

Plugins to be named with the `-plugin` suffix and optional `oc-` prefix.

```
blog-plugin
oc-blog-plugin
```

Themes to be named with the `-theme` suffix and optional `oc-` prefix.

```
happy-theme
oc-happy-theme
```

## Variable naming

Use **camelCase** everywhere except for the following:

* Database columns should use **snake_case**
* Language keys should use **snake_case**
