## Environment configuration

It is often helpful to have different configuration values based on the environment the application is running in. You can do this by setting the `APP_ENV` environment variable which by default it is set to **production**. There are two common ways to change this value:

1. Set `APP_ENV` value directly with your webserver.

    For example, in Apache this line can be added to the `.htaccess` or `httpd.config` file:

        SetEnv APP_ENV "dev"

2. Create a **.env** file in the root directory with the following content:

        APP_ENV=dev

In both of the above examples, the environment is set to the new value `dev`. Configuration files can now be created in the path **config/dev** and will override the application's base configuration.

For example, to use a different MySQL database for the `dev` environment only, create a file called **config/dev/database.php** using this content:

    <?php

    return [
        'connections' => [
            'mysql' => [
                'host'     => 'localhost',
                'port'     => '',
                'database' => 'database',
                'username' => 'root',
                'password' => ''
            ]
        ]
    ];
