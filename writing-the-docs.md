# How to style perfect October documentation pages

* Each page that has at least one H2 header should have a TOC list. The TOC list should be the first element after the H1 header. The TOC should have links to all H2 headers on the page.
* There should be an introductory text below the TOC, even if there is the Introduction section. You may want to get rid of the Introduction section if it's not really needed. Don't leave the TOC alone.
* Try to use only H2 and H3 headers.
* Each H2 and H3 header should have a link defined as <a name="page-cycle-handlers" class="anchor" href="#page-cycle-handlers"></a>
* Avoid short, 1 sentence, paragraphs. Merge short paragraphs and try to be a bit more verbose.
* Avoid short hanging paragraphs below code sections. Merge such paragraphs with the text above the code blocks.
* Use the inline `code` tags for everything related to code - variable names, function names, syntax examples, etc.
* Use the **strong** tag for everything else.
* Don't hesitate to make cross links to other documentation articles. Adding links to the same article in the same paragraph is not necessary.
* See the cms-pages.md or cms-themes.md files for your reference.
